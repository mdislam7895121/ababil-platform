GOAL (STEP 6 ONLY)
Implement multi-method payment collection with invoice control for Global + Bangladesh users.
This step must expand revenue options without breaking existing Stripe billing.

SCOPE RULES
1) Additive only. Do NOT refactor existing billing or revenue logic.
2) Owner/Admin only for approvals.
3) Manual payments must NOT auto-activate without admin approval.
4) Proof-first required.

WHAT TO BUILD (BACKEND)

A) ManualPayment Model (Prisma)
Fields:
- id
- workspaceId
- amount
- currency
- method (bkash, nagad, rocket, bank, cash)
- transactionRef
- proofImageUrl (optional)
- status (pending, approved, rejected)
- createdAt, approvedAt
- approvedBy

B) Invoice Model
- id
- workspaceId
- subscriptionPlan
- amount
- paymentType (stripe, manual)
- paymentId (stripeSessionId or manualPaymentId)
- status (pending, paid, rejected)
- issuedAt

C) APIs
- POST /api/payments/manual (customer submits payment info)
- GET /api/payments/manual/pending (admin only)
- POST /api/payments/manual/:id/approve
- POST /api/payments/manual/:id/reject
- GET /api/invoices (admin)
- GET /api/invoices/:id/pdf

D) Logic
- On manual approve → activate subscription
- On reject → no activation
- Audit log all actions

WHAT TO BUILD (FRONTEND)

E) Customer UI
- Payment option selector (Card / Manual)
- Manual payment form (method + ref + proof upload)
- Status indicator (Pending approval)

F) Admin UI
- New page: /dashboard/payments
- Tabs: Pending / Approved / Rejected
- Approve / Reject actions
- Invoice view/download

SECURITY
- RBAC enforced
- Tenant isolation mandatory
- Proof upload size/type validation

PROOF REQUIRED
1) Screenshot: Customer manual payment submission
2) Screenshot: Admin pending payment list
3) Screenshot: Approve action + status change
4) Screenshot: Invoice generated (manual)
5) API response samples
6) proof.md update

STOP CONDITION
Stop after STEP 6 is complete and verified.
Do NOT start STEP 7.
