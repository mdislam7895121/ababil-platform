ROLE:
You are upgrading the existing Digital Platform Factory to increase REAL customer demand and willingness to pay.
This is NOT a refactor. This is a demand-focused additive upgrade.

GLOBAL RULES (MANDATORY)
1) Non-breaking only. Do not refactor existing builder or modules.
2) Proof-first. No feature is “done” without visible UI + API proof.
3) Mobile-friendly UI. Everything must work from a phone browser.
4) Tenant-scoped, RBAC enforced.
5) No fake features. Everything must actually work.

GOAL OF THIS PHASE
Turn the Builder from a “cool demo” into a product customers TRUST and PAY FOR.

==============================
FEATURE SET (PHASE 1 – MUST IMPLEMENT ALL)
==============================

### 1) POST-BUILD CHECKLIST (CRITICAL)
After a successful Builder Run:
- Generate a tenant-scoped “Go Live Checklist”
- Store checklist items in DB
- Show checklist in UI

Checklist items (default):
- Add Database URL
- Add JWT Secret
- Configure Email Provider
- Configure Payment Provider (optional)
- Configure AI (optional)
- Run Deploy Verification

API:
- GET /api/checklist
- POST /api/checklist/complete (mark item done)

UI:
- Show progress bar (e.g. 2/6 completed)
- Show “What’s blocking Go Live”

Why:
Customers need guidance, not just features.

==============================

### 2) LIVE PREVIEW MODE (HIGH DEMAND)
After Builder Run:
- Seed demo data automatically
- Enable “Preview Mode”

Preview capabilities:
- View as Admin
- View as Staff
- View as Customer (read-only)

Rules:
- Preview uses real backend
- Preview data is clearly marked “Demo”
- Preview cannot send emails/SMS/payments

UI:
- “Preview Your App” button
- Role switcher dropdown

==============================

### 3) INDUSTRY PRESETS (MULTIPLIER)
Extend existing templates with presets:

Booking Business presets:
- Hair Salon
- Clinic
- Gym

Ecommerce presets:
- Grocery
- Clothing
- Pharmacy

Each preset modifies:
- Workflow labels
- Sample data
- Dashboard widgets text

UI:
- After template selection → “Choose Industry”
- Show short description (“Best for salons with staff schedules”)

==============================

### 4) COST TRANSPARENCY PANEL (TRUST BUILDER)
Add a “Estimated Monthly Cost” panel.

Show:
- Hosting: “Paid to your provider”
- Database: “Paid to your provider”
- Email: “Paid to your provider”
- AI: “Paid to your provider”
- Platform Fee: “Paid to us”

Values can be ranges or placeholders.
NO billing integration required.

UI:
- Visible before Build
- Visible after Build

==============================

### 5) FAILURE-SAFE HUMAN ERRORS
Replace generic errors with human messages.

Examples:
- “Database connection failed. Check DATABASE_URL.”
- “JWT_SECRET missing. App cannot start.”
- “AI disabled. No API key provided.”

Rules:
- No stack traces in UI
- Log technical detail internally only

==============================

DATABASE (PRISMA – ADD MODELS)
Add:
- ChecklistItem:
  id, tenantId, key, label, completed, createdAt

- PreviewSession:
  id, tenantId, role, expiresAt

==============================

PROOF REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
You must provide:
1) Screenshot of Checklist UI with progress
2) Screenshot of Preview mode (any role)
3) Screenshot of Industry preset selection
4) Screenshot of Cost panel
5) Updated reports/proof.md with:
   - Builder run
   - Checklist created
   - Preview enabled

==============================

STOP CONDITION
When all features are visible in UI and proof is attached.
Do not ask questions. Implement incrementally and safely.
