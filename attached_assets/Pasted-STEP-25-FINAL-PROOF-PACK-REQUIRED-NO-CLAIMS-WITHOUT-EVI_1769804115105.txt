STEP 25 FINAL PROOF PACK — REQUIRED (NO CLAIMS WITHOUT EVIDENCE)

Context
You stated STEP 25 is complete. Provide concrete proof that STEP 25 scope is implemented:
- Mobile App Builder backend APIs: /api/mobile/spec/draft, /api/mobile/spec/approve, /api/mobile/project/generate
- Web dashboard UI: /dashboard/mobile/builder
- apps/mobile generated/updated files for Expo shell
If your work was actually "Agent Chat UI fixes", explicitly say STEP 25 is NOT complete and label it as a separate patch. No mixing.

A) API PROOFS (RAW)
1) List routes file(s) containing mobile endpoints:
- Show exact file paths and code snippets where routes are registered.
- Also show index.ts/route registration proof.

2) Run and paste FULL curl outputs (no truncation):
- POST /api/mobile/spec/draft
  curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mobile/spec/draft \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OWNER_TOKEN" -H "x-tenant-id: $TENANT_ID" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"prompt":"Build a booking app with login, preview, settings, and Bengali language support"}'

- POST /api/mobile/spec/approve
  curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mobile/spec/approve \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OWNER_TOKEN" -H "x-tenant-id: $TENANT_ID" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"specId":"<SPEC_ID_FROM_DRAFT>"}'

- POST /api/mobile/project/generate
  curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mobile/project/generate \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OWNER_TOKEN" -H "x-tenant-id: $TENANT_ID" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"approvedSpecId":"<APPROVED_SPEC_ID>","target":"expo"}'

B) WEB UI PROOF
1) Confirm page exists:
- Show file path for Next.js page: apps/web/src/app/dashboard/mobile/builder/page.tsx (or equivalent)
- Paste first ~60 lines of the page.
2) Run and paste:
- curl -I http://localhost:3000/dashboard/mobile/builder (must be 200 after auth flow OR show redirect)
3) Provide screenshot(s) OR Playwright output proving:
- Prompt box visible
- Generated spec summary visible
- Approve + Generate buttons visible

C) EXPO PROJECT PROOF (apps/mobile)
1) Show changed/added files:
- git diff --name-only
- ls -la apps/mobile
- ls -la apps/mobile/app
2) Confirm required routes exist in code:
- /login
- /(tabs)/index
- /preview/[token]
- /invite/[token]
- /(tabs)/settings
Paste the route file paths and minimal snippets that prove each route exists.
3) Show SecureStore usage:
- grep output (or snippet) proving SecureStore token save/load.
4) Show deep linking scheme:
- paste linking config snippet: platformfactory://

D) REGRESSION PROOF (RAW)
1) ./scripts/smoke.sh (FULL output)
2) ./scripts/verify.sh (last ~40 lines)

E) ARTIFACTS
1) Create reports/step25-proof.md containing:
- A) curl proofs
- B) UI proof
- C) file list
- D) smoke/verify outputs summary
2) Paste:
- first 40 lines of reports/step25-proof.md
- git status
- last commit hash

STOP after posting all proofs.
No further steps.
