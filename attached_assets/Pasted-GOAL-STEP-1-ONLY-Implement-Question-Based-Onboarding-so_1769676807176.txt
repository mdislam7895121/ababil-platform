GOAL (STEP 1 ONLY)
Implement Question-Based Onboarding so users can create a platform WITHOUT writing prompts.
Prompt must be hidden. The system should ask simple questions and generate the draft blueprint behind the scenes.

SCOPE RULES
1) Additive only. Do NOT refactor existing Builder endpoints or templates.
2) Use existing Builder APIs:
   - GET /api/builder/templates
   - POST /api/builder/draft
   - POST /api/builder/approve
   - POST /api/builder/run
3) Mobile-first UI. Must work cleanly on phone browser.
4) RBAC: owner/admin can run builds; staff/viewer can preview only.
5) Proof-first: Provide UI screenshots + API call evidence.

WHAT TO BUILD (UI)
A) New page: /dashboard/onboarding
- A step-by-step wizard with 5–7 questions:
  Step 1: Choose business type (ONLY: Hair Salon/Beauty, Clinic/Diagnostic, Courier/Delivery)
  Step 2: Business name + city
  Step 3: Staff count (1 / 2–5 / 6–20 / 20+)
  Step 4: Do you need online payment? (Yes/No)
  Step 5: Do you want notifications? (Email / SMS / WhatsApp / None)
  Step 6 (optional): Working hours (simple preset: 9–6, 10–8, 24/7)
  Step 7: Review summary + “Generate my platform”

B) Results screen (same page or /dashboard/onboarding/result)
- Shows:
  - Selected preset
  - Generated modules list
  - Estimated monthly cost (reuse existing /api/costs if available)
  - Button: “Create Draft” (calls builder draft)
  - Then: “Approve & Build” (calls approve + run)
- DO NOT show any raw prompt text to the user.
- Show friendly status: “Generating blueprint…”, “Ready to build…”, “Building…”

PROMPT GENERATION (HIDDEN)
- Convert answers into an internal prompt string (server-side preferred; client-side allowed if no endpoint exists).
- Example internal prompt (never shown):
  “Create a booking system for a hair salon in Queens with 2–5 staff, no online payments, email notifications, hours 10–8.”

BACKEND (MINIMAL, ONLY IF NEEDED)
If there is no clean way to generate the internal prompt safely:
- Add endpoint: POST /api/onboarding/draft
  Input: answers JSON
  Output: uses builder/template classifier to call existing /api/builder/draft internally
- Must sanitize inputs (no secrets, no emails in business name field, etc.)
- Tenant-scoped. Audit log “ONBOARDING_DRAFT_CREATED”.

NAVIGATION
- Add a primary CTA in dashboard sidebar/top:
  “Create with Questions” -> /dashboard/onboarding
- Keep existing Builder page intact.

ERROR HANDLING
- Human-friendly errors only.
- If user is not owner/admin and clicks build, show: “Ask an admin to run the build.”

PROOF REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
Provide:
1) Screenshot: /dashboard/onboarding Step 1–2 on mobile width
2) Screenshot: Review + “Generate my platform”
3) Screenshot: Result screen showing modules + build buttons
4) Evidence of API calls (one of):
   - server logs of POST /api/builder/draft and /api/builder/run
   - or curl outputs used during verification (no secrets)
5) Update reports/proof.md with:
   - routes/pages added
   - what was tested
   - screenshots list

STOP CONDITION
Stop after STEP 1 is complete and proven. Do NOT start STEP 2+.
