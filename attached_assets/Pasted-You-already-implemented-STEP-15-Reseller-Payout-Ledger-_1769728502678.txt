You already implemented STEP 15 (Reseller Payout Ledger + Settlement).
Now STOP narrating and ONLY output the REQUIRED RAW PROOFS.

TASK: Produce STEP 15 FINAL PROOF PACK with raw curl outputs + PASS outputs.

1) Identify IDs (print them once at top):
- ADMIN_TOKEN (or OWNER_TOKEN) you used
- STAFF_TOKEN
- RESELLER_TOKEN
- TENANT_ID
- RESELLER_ID
- A PAID invoiceId linked to that reseller (invoice must be paid)

2) RAW PROOFS (paste exact command + exact output)

A) Ledger accrual exists
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/resellers/<RESELLER_ID>/ledger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>"
Show at least one entry:
- type="commission_accrual"
- invoiceId matches paid invoice
- amount equals commission

B) Generate payout (owed)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/resellers/<RESELLER_ID>/payouts/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"periodStart":"2026-01-01","periodEnd":"2026-01-31","currency":"USD"}'
Output must include:
- payoutId
- status="owed"
- grossRevenue, commissionEarned, netPayable

C) Approve payout (approved)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/resellers/<RESELLER_ID>/payouts/<PAYOUT_ID>/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>"
Output must show status="approved" and approvedAt set.

D) Mark paid (paid + payout ledger entry)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/resellers/<RESELLER_ID>/payouts/<PAYOUT_ID>/mark-paid \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"payoutMethod":"bank","payoutDetails":{"ref":"TX123"}}'
Output must show status="paid", paidAt set.

Then show ledger includes a negative payout entry:
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/resellers/<RESELLER_ID>/ledger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>"
Must include:
- type="payout"
- amount negative equals -netPayable

E) RBAC proof
1) Staff cannot approve:
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/resellers/<RESELLER_ID>/payouts/<PAYOUT_ID>/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <STAFF_TOKEN>"
Must return HTTP 403

2) Reseller can view own payouts, but not others:
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/my/reseller/payouts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <RESELLER_TOKEN>"
Must return 200 and show only reseller’s payouts.

F) Regression proof
Paste full outputs:
./scripts/smoke.sh
./scripts/verify.sh  (last ~40 lines showing PASS)

G) Artifacts
Paste top section of reports/step15-proof.md
Paste:
git status
List changed files

STOP after printing these proofs. No commentary.
