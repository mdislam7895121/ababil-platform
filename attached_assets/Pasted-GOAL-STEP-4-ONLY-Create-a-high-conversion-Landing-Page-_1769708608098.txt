GOAL (STEP 4 ONLY)
Create a high-conversion Landing Page and a simple Sales Funnel that drives:
Landing → Question-Based Onboarding → Live Preview → Paid Go-Live.

This step is about CUSTOMER ACQUISITION, not new core features.

SCOPE RULES
1) Additive only. Do NOT refactor backend logic (builder, preview, billing).
2) Reuse existing onboarding, preview, and paid gate flows.
3) Mobile-first. Landing must look strong on phones.
4) Hard-focus on ONLY 3 industries:
   - Hair Salon / Beauty
   - Clinic / Diagnostic
   - Courier / Delivery
5) Proof-first: screenshots + funnel evidence required.

WHAT TO BUILD (FRONTEND)

A) Public Landing Page (/)
Headline (exact):
“30 minutes to launch your business software”

Sub-headline:
“No code. No mistakes. Preview free. Pay only when you go live.”

Industry Selector (3 cards only):
- Hair Salon / Beauty
- Clinic / Diagnostic
- Courier / Delivery

Primary CTA:
“Try free preview”

Secondary CTA:
“See how it works” (scrolls to demo steps)

B) How It Works Section (Simple, Visual)
Show 4 steps only:
1. Answer simple questions
2. Instantly preview your app
3. Share demo with your team
4. Go live when ready (paid)

C) Trust Builders
- “Zero-Thinking Mode” explanation:
  “The system blocks mistakes before you go live”
- Cost transparency note:
  “Most customers pay $39/month”
- Security note:
  “Your data stays in your control”

D) Funnel Wiring (CRITICAL)
- “Try free preview” →
  Redirect to /dashboard/onboarding
- After onboarding →
  Auto-redirect to Preview screen
- Preview →
  Clear CTA: “Go Live”
- Go Live →
  Paid Gate (existing STEP 3 flow)

NO other CTAs allowed.

E) SEO + Sharing
- Page title + meta description
- Social preview (OG title/description)
- Fast load, no heavy assets

COPY RULES
- Result-focused language only
- No technical jargon
- No feature lists longer than 3 bullets

PROOF REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
Provide:
1) Screenshot (mobile width): Landing hero section
2) Screenshot: Industry selector + CTA
3) Screenshot: “How it works” section
4) Proof of funnel:
   - Click “Try free preview” → onboarding page opens
5) proof.md update:
   - Landing page URL
   - Funnel steps
   - Copy used (headline + CTA)

STOP CONDITION
Stop after STEP 4 is complete and proven.
Do NOT start STEP 5 (Marketing/Ads/Scale).
