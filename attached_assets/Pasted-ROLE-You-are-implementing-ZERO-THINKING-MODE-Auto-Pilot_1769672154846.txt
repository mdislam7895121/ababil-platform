ROLE:
You are implementing ZERO-THINKING MODE (Auto-Pilot UX) on top of the existing Digital Platform Factory.
Goal: Customers should not have to think about setup, configuration, or deployment order.
The system must guide, validate, block unsafe actions, and explain issues in human language.

GLOBAL RULES
1) Additive only. Do NOT refactor existing Builder, Modules, or Connectors.
2) Proof-first. Every feature must be visible in UI and verifiable via API.
3) Tenant-scoped, RBAC enforced (owner/admin only for critical actions).
4) Human-readable errors only. No stack traces in UI.
5) Mobile-friendly (phone browser usable).

================================
FEATURE SET (ZERO-THINKING MODE)
================================

### 1) GUIDED SETUP (AUTO-PILOT)
After a successful Builder Run, automatically start “Guided Setup”.

Steps (fixed order, auto-advance on success):
1. Database
2. Secrets (JWT / Encryption)
3. Email (optional)
4. Payments (optional)
5. AI (optional)
6. Deploy Verification

Rules:
- Each step explains: What it is, Why needed, How to fix if failed
- Cannot skip required steps
- Optional steps clearly marked
- Progress bar always visible (e.g., 3/6 completed)

API:
- GET /api/setup/state
- POST /api/setup/step/:key/verify
- POST /api/setup/step/:key/complete

UI:
- /dashboard/setup (Auto-opens after Builder Run)
- “Continue Setup” button always visible until LIVE

================================

### 2) SMART DEFAULTS (NO DECISIONS)
Pre-fill everything reasonable:
- Workflow labels
- Role permissions
- Notification toggles
- Dashboard widgets
- Module configs

Customer can change later, but default must work immediately.

================================

### 3) ENVIRONMENT AUTO-GENERATOR
Generate secrets automatically:
- JWT_SECRET
- ENCRYPTION_KEY

Rules:
- Generate server-side
- Show once with Copy button
- Warn: “Save this securely. It will not be shown again.”

API:
- POST /api/env/generate

================================

### 4) PRE-FLIGHT CHECK (BLOCK BAD DEPLOYS)
Before “Go Live”, automatically check:
- Database reachable
- Required env present
- At least one admin user
- No critical module misconfig

If any fail:
- Block deploy
- Show exact fix in plain language

API:
- POST /api/deploy/preflight

================================

### 5) HEALTH MONITOR (TRAFFIC LIGHT)
Show app health at top of dashboard:
- 🟢 Healthy
- 🟡 Action required
- 🔴 Critical issue

Click status to see:
- What’s wrong
- How to fix
- Direct link to the fix screen

API:
- GET /api/health/summary

================================

### 6) SAFE MODE (DAMAGE CONTROL)
If critical config missing:
- Auto-disable emails
- Auto-disable payments
- Auto-disable AI

App remains usable.
Show banner: “Safe Mode active — no external actions will run.”

================================

### 7) WHAT YOU’RE MISSING PANEL
System proactively lists missing but recommended items:
- “Email not configured → users won’t get notifications”
- “Payment not configured → orders won’t be paid”
- “AI enabled without quota → risk of overuse”

UI:
- Dismissible suggestions
- Clear priority labels

================================

### 8) SIMPLE ANALYTICS (ZERO SETUP)
Out-of-the-box metrics:
- Active users (today)
- Requests today
- Failed actions
- AI usage summary

No configuration required.

================================

### 9) AUTO DOCUMENTATION
After Builder + Setup:
Auto-generate:
- Admin Guide
- Staff Guide
- API Summary (read-only)

Accessible from dashboard.
No PDFs required for MVP.

================================

DATABASE (PRISMA – ADD MODELS)
Add tenant-scoped models:
- SetupStep:
  id, tenantId, key, status(pending|passed|failed), lastCheckedAt

- HealthStatus:
  id, tenantId, status(green|yellow|red), message, updatedAt

================================

PROOF REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
You must provide:
1) Screenshot: Guided Setup with progress bar
2) Screenshot: Pre-flight failure message (human text)
3) Screenshot: Health Monitor (traffic light)
4) Screenshot: Safe Mode banner
5) Updated reports/proof.md showing:
   - Setup steps verification
   - Pre-flight block
   - Health summary response

================================

STOP CONDITION
When:
- Guided Setup auto-opens
- Required steps cannot be skipped
- Deploy is blocked until safe
- Health status is visible
- Proof is attached

Do NOT ask questions. Implement incrementally and safely.
