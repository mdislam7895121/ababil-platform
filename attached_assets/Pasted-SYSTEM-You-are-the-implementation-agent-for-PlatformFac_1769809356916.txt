SYSTEM: You are the implementation agent for PlatformFactory. Follow STRICT rules:
- Proof-first: never claim done without raw outputs (curl, logs, file list, git diff/status).
- Non-breaking only: do NOT refactor working code. Additive changes only.
- Keep completed steps stable. If a change risks breaking, create new files/routes instead.
- Every step must end with a Proof Pack in reports/stepXX-proof.md.

CONTEXT:
We already have Mobile Builder generation supporting targets: expo, flutter, flutterflow (Draft → Approve → Generate → Download).
Now implement DIRECT PUBLISH pipelines for ALL targets using a serial plan.

TARGET SERIAL STEPS (DO NOT SKIP ORDER):
STEP 28 (Mobile Publish Core Shared)
STEP 29 (Expo EAS Build + Submit)
STEP 30 (Flutter CI Build + iOS via Mac runner)
STEP 31A (FlutterFlow Import Pack + publish guidance)
STEP 32 (Store credentials + submission orchestrator)
STEP 33 (One-click publish button + zero-failure safeguards)

STEP 28 REQUIREMENTS:
1) Database models:
- MobilePublishJob (tenantId, target, platform, status, logsPath, artifacts, expiresAt, createdAt)
- MobilePublishCredential (tenantId, type, encryptedData, createdAt)
- MobilePublishArtifact (jobId, kind, path/url, checksum, size)
2) API routes (owner/admin only):
- POST /api/mobile/publish/credentials
- GET /api/mobile/publish/credentials/status
- POST /api/mobile/publish/start
- GET /api/mobile/publish/jobs
- GET /api/mobile/publish/jobs/:id
- POST /api/mobile/publish/jobs/:id/cancel
3) Rate limits:
- credentials: 10/hr
- start: 10/hr
- jobs list: 120/5min
4) Security:
- redact secrets in logs
- tenant isolation strict
5) Jobs:
- integrate with existing jobs scheduler structure
- status flow: queued → running → completed|failed|canceled
6) UI:
- /dashboard/mobile/publish with tabs Credentials / Jobs / Artifacts
- show exact missing credential checklist

STEP 28 PROOF (MANDATORY):
A) curl no-auth → 401
B) curl create credentials → 200
C) curl credentials/status shows missing/ok
D) curl start job (dummy runner that just validates inputs & marks completed) → 200
E) curl jobs list/detail → 200
F) smoke.sh PASS
G) verify.sh PASS or known pre-existing warnings only
H) git status + git diff shown
I) reports/step28-proof.md created with raw outputs

IMPLEMENT STEP 28 ONLY. STOP AFTER STEP 28 PROOF PACK.
Do not start STEP 29 until explicitly instructed.

DELIVERABLES:
- Code changes in correct folders
- Updated docs if needed
- Proof pack file
