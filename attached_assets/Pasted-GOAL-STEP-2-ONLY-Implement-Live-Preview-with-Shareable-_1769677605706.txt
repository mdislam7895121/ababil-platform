GOAL (STEP 2 ONLY)
Implement Live Preview with Shareable Demo Links so users can view and share a demo of the built platform without going live.
This must increase trust and reduce sales friction.

SCOPE RULES
1) Additive only. Do NOT refactor existing Preview, Builder, or Deploy logic.
2) Reuse existing Preview infrastructure if present.
3) Mobile-first UI. Must work cleanly on phone browsers.
4) RBAC:
   - owner/admin can create preview links
   - staff/viewer can open preview links (read-only)
5) Proof-first: Provide screenshots + API evidence.

WHAT TO BUILD

A) Preview Creation
- Add a button in dashboard (Builder Result / Deploy page):
  “Create Live Preview”
- Creates a demo preview session with:
  • Demo data only
  • Read-only mode
  • No email/SMS/payment processing
  • Clear “DEMO / PREVIEW” watermark
  • 24-hour expiry (configurable)

B) Shareable Preview Link
- Generate a public, tokenized URL:
  /preview/{token}
- Anyone with the link can open (no login)
- Token must be time-limited and revocable
- Show copy/share UI (copy button)

C) Preview Viewer UI
- Public preview page:
  • Uses same UI shell as real app
  • Top banner: “Preview Mode – expires in X hours”
  • Disable any write actions (forms submit blocked)
- If expired or revoked:
  • Show friendly message + “Ask admin for new preview”

D) Preview Management
- New page or section:
  /dashboard/previews
- List previews:
  • status (active/expired/revoked)
  • expiry time
  • revoke button
- Audit log:
  PREVIEW_CREATED, PREVIEW_REVOKED, PREVIEW_VIEWED

BACKEND (ONLY IF NEEDED)
If not already present:
- POST /api/preview/create
- GET /api/preview/{token}
- POST /api/preview/revoke
Security:
- Tenant-scoped
- No secrets exposed
- Strict read-only enforcement

UX REQUIREMENTS
- Clear demo watermark
- Countdown to expiry
- Share button
- Human-friendly errors

PROOF REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
Provide:
1) Screenshot (mobile width):
   - Preview creation button and confirmation
2) Screenshot:
   - Public preview page (/preview/{token}) showing DEMO banner
3) Screenshot:
   - Preview management list with status
4) Evidence of API calls:
   - preview/create
   - preview/{token}
5) proof.md update:
   - routes/pages added
   - preview security rules
   - expiry + revocation behavior

STOP CONDITION
Stop after STEP 2 is complete and proven.
Do NOT start STEP 3 (Paid Gate / Pricing).
