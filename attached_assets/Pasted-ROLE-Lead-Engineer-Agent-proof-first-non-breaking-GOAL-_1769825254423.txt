ROLE: Lead Engineer Agent (proof-first, non-breaking)

GOAL
Fix the Ababil CI so “Mobile Publish Build” runs green by adding a minimal Expo project structure to the GitHub repo and updating the workflow to build it. Keep the existing CI callback flow working (API → GitHub Actions → callback → API update).

CONTEXT
Repo: mdislam7895121/ababil-platform
Workflow file exists: .github/workflows/mobile-publish.yml
GitHub Secrets already used: API_BASE_URL, CI_CALLBACK_TOKEN
Current runs fail because repo has no real mobile project (no apps/mobile, package.json, eas.json).

STRICT RULES
1) Do not claim “fixed” without proof.
2) Make minimal diffs, additive changes only.
3) No refactors. Only add what is required to make CI green.
4) Do not expose or print secrets in logs.
5) After changes, trigger a workflow run and provide run URL + logs proof.

TASKS (DO IN ORDER)
A) Inspect current repo contents
- Show: git status, tree -a (or ls -R), and current .github/workflows/mobile-publish.yml content.

B) Add minimal Expo app in apps/mobile (publish-ready skeleton)
Create:
- apps/mobile/package.json (expo + react-native minimal)
- apps/mobile/app.json (or app.config.js)
- apps/mobile/App.js (or app/index.js)
- apps/mobile/babel.config.js
- apps/mobile/.gitignore (optional)
- apps/mobile/eas.json with minimal build profiles:
  - "preview" profile with non-interactive safe defaults (no credentials required for “build” step in CI; do NOT attempt store submit yet)
Also add repo root package.json only if needed (prefer keeping everything under apps/mobile).

C) Update GitHub Actions workflow to actually build the Expo project
- Ensure workflow runs inside apps/mobile.
- Use actions/setup-node.
- Install deps with npm ci (or npm install if lock not present).
- Run “npx expo --version” and “npx expo-doctor” (optional).
- Run “npx expo export” OR “npx expo prebuild --no-install” OR “npx expo start --non-interactive --help”:
  Choose a CI-safe command that will pass without EXPO_TOKEN and without Apple/Google credentials.
  Goal right now: make workflow green, and keep callbacks.

IMPORTANT:
- Keep the existing “Notify API - started” and “Notify API - completed” callback steps unchanged and working.

D) Commit and push
- Provide git diff.
- Commit message: “Add minimal Expo mobile app for CI green”
- Push to main.

E) Proof
- Trigger workflow_dispatch (target=expo, jobId dummy) and share:
  1) GitHub Actions run URL
  2) Screenshot/log snippets showing steps succeeded (install + build command)
  3) Callback response evidence (API updated job status to completed/success OR at least callback received)

DEFINITION OF DONE
- Latest “Mobile Publish Build” run is GREEN.
- Workflow shows it executed within apps/mobile and ran Expo command successfully.
- Callback step executed and returned HTTP success (or clear proof in logs + API state).

DELIVERABLES
- List of files added with paths
- git diff (relevant parts)
- Actions run URL and proof snippets
