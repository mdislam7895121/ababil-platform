STEP 6 PROOF PACK (MANDATORY)
Provide hard proof that Multi-Method Payment + Invoice Control is реально working.

A) API PROOF (raw outputs)
1) Submit manual payment:
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/payments/manual \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <OWNER_TOKEN>" \
     -H "x-tenant-id: <TENANT_ID>" \
     -d '{
       "method":"bkash",
       "amount":4500,
       "currency":"BDT",
       "transactionRef":"TEST-BKASH-123"
     }'

2) List self submissions:
   curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/payments/manual/self \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <OWNER_TOKEN>" \
     -H "x-tenant-id: <TENANT_ID>"

3) Admin list pending:
   curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/payments/manual?status=pending" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <OWNER_TOKEN>" \
     -H "x-tenant-id: <TENANT_ID>"

4) Approve payment (copy real id from #3):
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/payments/manual/<PAYMENT_ID>/approve \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <OWNER_TOKEN>" \
     -H "x-tenant-id: <TENANT_ID>" \
     -d '{"note":"approved for test"}'

5) Verify billing status after approve:
   curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/billing/status \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <OWNER_TOKEN>" \
     -H "x-tenant-id: <TENANT_ID>"

6) Invoices list:
   curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/invoices \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <OWNER_TOKEN>" \
     -H "x-tenant-id: <TENANT_ID>"

7) Invoice PDF (pick real invoice id from #6):
   curl -I http://localhost:5000/api/invoices/<INVOICE_ID>/pdf \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <OWNER_TOKEN>" \
     -H "x-tenant-id: <TENANT_ID>"

B) UI PROOF (screenshots)
1) /dashboard/billing
   - Currency toggle visible
   - Manual methods visible
   - Payment submission success toast/status

2) /dashboard/payments (admin)
   - Pending tab shows the submitted payment
   - Approve action done
   - Status becomes Approved

3) Invoice PDF download working (show browser download or HTTP 200 headers)

C) SECURITY PROOF
1) Staff/viewer cannot access admin endpoints:
   - Call GET /api/payments/manual with a STAFF token → must return 403
2) Cross-tenant isolation:
   - Use a second tenant header and show it cannot see first tenant payments

D) FILE/CHANGE PROOF
1) git status
2) git diff summary (or list of changed files)
3) Update reports/proof.md with the outputs and screenshots references
